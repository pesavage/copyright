Source code and data for the analyses reported in: Savage, P. E., Cronin, C., Müllensiefen, D., &amp; Atkinson, Q. D. (2018). Quantitative evaluation of music copyright infringement. In A.

To run the analysis, open R and run the code found in the file "my_CopyrightPMI.R". This will produce the output file "PMI.csv", but this file is also included here for completeness. (Thanks to Haruo Suzuki @haruosuz for editing the previous "CopyrightPMI.R" into a more streamlined version.) 

Musical transcriptions prior to converting into string sequences are also provided as given by Müllensiefen and Pendzich (2009). MIDI files for one case (Selle vs. Gibbe) were not available, so instead these transcriptions have been provided in the form of the image published in Müllensiefen, D., & Pendzich, M. (2009). Court decisions on music plagiarism and the predictive value of similarity algorithms. Musicae Scientiae, 13(1 Suppl), 257–295.
